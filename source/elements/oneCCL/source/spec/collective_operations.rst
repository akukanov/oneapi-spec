Collective Operations
=====================

oneCCL specification defines the following collective communication operations:

- `Allgather`_
- `Allgatherv`_
- `Allreduce`_
- `Alltoallv`_
- `Barrier`_
- `Broadcast`_
- `Reduce`_
- `ReduceScatter`_
- `PointToPoint`_

These operations are collective, meaning that all participants (ranks) of oneCCL communicator should make a call.
The order of collective operation calls should be the same across all ranks.

``communicator`` shall provide the ability to perform communication operations either on host or device memory buffers depending on the ``device`` used to create the communicator. Additionally, communication operations shall accept an execution context (stream) and may accept a vector of events that the communication operation should depend on, that is, input dependencies. The output ``event`` object shall provide the ability to track the progress of the operation.

.. note::
    Support for handling of input events is optional

``BufferType`` is used below to define the C++ type of elements in data buffers (``buf``, ``send_buf`` and  ``recv_buf``) of communication operations. At least the following types shall be supported: ``[u]int{8/16/32/64}_t``, ``float``, ``double``. The explicit ``datatype`` parameter shall be used to enable data types which cannot be inferred from the function arguments.

.. note::
    See also: :ref:`Custom Datatypes`

The communication operation accepts a ``stream`` object. If a communicator is created from ``native_device_type``, then the stream shall translate to ``native_stream_type`` created from the corresponding device.

The communication operation may accept attribute object. If that parameter is missed, then the default attribute object is used (default_<operation_name>_attr). The default attribute object shall be provided by the library.

.. note::
    See also: :doc:`operation_attributes`

If the arguments provided to a communication operation call do not comply to the requirements of the operation, the behavior is undefined unless it is specified otherwise.


.. _Allgather:

Allgather
*********

Allgather is a collective communication operation that collects the ``send_count`` elements from all the ranks within the communicator and places the results into ``recv_buf``, in such a way that data from rank ``i`` can be found at offset rank ``i * count``. The resulting data in the output ``recv_buf`` buffer is the same for each rank. 


Allgather is in place when ``sendbuff == recvbuff + rank * send_count``. 

.. code:: cpp

     template<class BufferType> 
     event ccl::allgather(const BufferType* send_buf, 
                          BufferType* recv_buf,

the ranks within a communicator into a single buffer. Different ranks may
contribute segments of different sizes. The resulting data in the output buffer
must be the same for each rank.

Allgatherv is in place when  ``send_buf == recv_buf + rank_offset``, where
``rank_offset = sum (recv_counts[i])``, for all ``i < rank``.

.. _PointToPoint:

Point-To-Point Operations
*************************

OneCCL specification defines the following point-to-point operations:

* Send
* Recv

In point-to-point communication, two ranks participate in the communication so when a process sends data to a peer rank, 
the peer rank needs to post a ``recv`` call with the same datatype and count as the sending rank. 

The current specification only supports blocking ``send`` and ``recv`` and does not support for multiple ``send``
and ``receive`` operations to proceed concurrently. 

In the ``send`` operation, the peer specifies the destination process, while in the recv operation peer specifies the source process. 

As with the collective operations, the communicator can perform communication operations on host or device memory buffers 
depending on the device used to create the communicator. Additionally, communication operations accept an execution 
context (stream) and may accept a vector of events on which the communication operation should depend, that is, input dependencies. 
The output event object provides the ability to track the operation's progress.

.. note:: Support for the handling of input events is optional.

BufferType is used below to define the C++ type of elements in communication operations' data buffers 
(``buf``, ``send_buf``, and ``recv_buf``). At least the following types should be supported: ``[u]int{8/16/32/64}_t, float, double``. 
The explicit datatype parameter enable data types that cannot be inferred from the function arguments.
For more information, see Custom Datatypes.

The communication operation accepts a stream object. If a communicator is created from ``native_device_type``, 
then the stream translates to ``native_stream_type`` created from the corresponding device.

The communication operation may accept attribute objects. If that parameter is missed, then the default attribute object is used 
(``default_<operation_name>_attr``). The default attribute object is provided by the library.
For more information, see Operation Attributes. 

If the arguments provided to a communication operation call do not comply with the requirements of the operation, 
the behavior is undefined, unless otherwise specified.

Send

A blocking point-to-point communication operation that sends the data in a buf to a peer rank.

Recv
^^^^^

A blocking point-to-point communication operation that receives the data in a buf from a peer rank.

.. code:: cpp

   template <class BufferType,
             event CCL_API recv(BufferType *buf,
                      size_t count,
